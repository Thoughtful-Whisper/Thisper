## Introduction

### What is Thisper?

Thisper evaluates users' comments for biased or contradictory content, visualizes them with colors, and facilitates communication with GPT about these comments, helping to shape individual ethical values on the internet.

### Motivation

In todayâ€™s digital age, the internet has become a double-edge sword. while it serves as a platform for knowledge sharing and global communication, it also harbors a culture of excessive conflict, rampant criticism, and forceful ideologies.
We see this manifest in many ways - from gender conflicts and political polarization, to the normalization of hate speech and the imposition of certain idelogies. Thes negative aspects not only stifle constructive debate but also breed a toxic environment that can be harmful to userâ€™s mental health.

### Our Solution

In order to solve these issues, we have considered the following
approaches:

1. Education: We emphasize on educating about online behavior,
   conversation norms, and ways to discern the credibility of
   information.

2. Encouraging User Participation: We support efforts by users to
   recognize and improve the problems of internet communities.

3. Utilizing Technology: We use artificial intelligence to
   automatically detect and manage biased or hateful remarks.

Through these approaches, we are confident that we can solve the
problems of the internet environment, and to realize this, we have
developed Thisper.

Thisper analyzes YouTube comments and visualizes excessive biases and malicious comments in red as a warning to users. It also provides a chat window where users can discuss their thoughts and stories about the visualized comments.

If a user finds a comment that they enjoyed and agreed with a lot being colored in red, it could be an opportunity to reflect on whether they have been thinking too one-sidedly. If they can have many conversations with GPT about this, they can naturally develop their ability to have logical and constructive discussions.

In this way, Thisper will approach our current society, which lacks understanding and respect for others and has severe conflicts, like a wise whisper, making great efforts to create a better internet world.
